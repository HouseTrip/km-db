Hi - This is KISSmetrics just letting you know that we'll be exporting your data here shortly. The data will be organized into subdirectories like so:

Your S3 Bucket/
  revisions/
    1.json
    2.json
    ...
    N.json
    
We will export all of your data from when you first sent us data. We export data every 12 hours and export as many days of your data as possible in a given time limit. You can check on the progress of your data export at https://www.kissmetrics.com/data_export. We will only export data up to "yesterday". 

If you plan to script a system to import this data you can easily set up a cron or other mechanism to check for the new data file every 5 minutes.

Inside of each JSON file you will find lines of JSON. Each line is a single hash separated by a newline. To parse, read each line one at a time. 

If you passed us an event with no additional properties the line would export as:

  {"_p":"john", "_t":1234567890, "_n":"Visited Site"}
  
* _p is the person's identity who did the event.
* _t is the UTC UNIX timestamp of when the event happened.
* _n is the name of of the event

If you passed in an event with properties it would export as:

  {"_p":"john", "_t":1234567890, "_n":"Visited Site", "url":"http://mysite.com", "campaign name":"my campaign"}
  
If a you passed us just properties with no event it would export as:

  {"_p":"john", "_t":1234567890, "url":"http://mysite.com", "campaign name":"my campaign"}

If you set each property as two separate calls they will be exported as two separate lines:

  {"_p":"john", "_t":1234567890, "url":"http://mysite.com"}
  {"_p":"john", "_t":1234567890, "campaign name":"my campaign"}
  
If you passed us an alias command it will be exported as:

  {"_p":"john", "_t":1234567890, "_p2":"john@kissmetrics.com"}
